        <h1>How to get started with web development if you are a complete beginner-Blog</h1>
    <small>December 16, 2022</small>
    <p class="blog">First, you should learn about how the internet works and how these sites are working on the internet. Keep your basics strong from the very beginning, and after you understand all these concepts, you can move a little forward and start learning about the languages that are used to build websites. begin with HTML You can even refer to some free resources out there on the internet, like www.w3schools.com, to learn very basic and important concepts of HTML, such as what an HTML skeleton is and its different tags, such as h1 tags, and many more.<br>
        <br>

        After learning about HTML, you can move on to learning about the styling of websites because you can only build the structure of a website through HTML, but if you want to add some styling to your website to make it more attractive, you have to learn CSS, i.e., cascading style sheets.<br>
        <br>
        
        <b>So you now have a lovely static website.</b><br>
        <br>
        
        Now, if you feel like you are now proficient in HTML and CSS, we can move forward and learn JavaScript. <br>
        <br>
       <b> What is JavaScript?</b><br>
        <br>
        JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Why should one Learn Js?</b> <br>
        <br>
        JavaScript makes web pagesÂ dynamic. Before JavaScript, web pages were built only with HTML and CSS. HTML and CSS are only capable of creating static pages that can be styled but are not interactive aside from hyperlinks. Some of the most popular websites are built with JavaScript, including Google, YouTube, and Facebook. <br> 
        <br>
        JavaScript allows developers to implement features like: <br>
        <br>
        
        - Showing and hiding menus or information <br>
        -Adding hover effects <br>
        -Creating image galleries in a carousel format <br>
        -Zooming in or zooming out on an image <br>
        -Playing audio or video on a web page <br>
        -Adding animations <br>
        -Creating drop-down and hamburger-style menus <br>
        <br>
